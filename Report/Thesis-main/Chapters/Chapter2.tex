\section{Optimisation in Air Travel}

In this section, some of the most common optimisation problems in the airline industry are discussed, such as the crew management, diruption handling, airlines' adapation to new demand and the flight connection.

These topics are discussed to illustrate the crucial role of optimisation in enhancing airline operational efficiency, reducing costs, and boosting passenger satisfaction.
The goal is to provide insight into some of the most important optimisation problems, underscoring their importance for the success and competitiveness of airline companies.

\subsection{Fleet Assignment Problem}


The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP), as discussed in \cite{airline_fleet_assignement} involves assigning different types of aircraft, each with specific capacities, to flights based on their capabilities, operational costs, and revenue potential. This decision greatly influences airline revenues and is a vital part of the overall scheduling process. The complexity of FAP is driven by the large number of flights an airline manages daily and its interdependencies with other processes like maintenance and crew scheduling.


\subsection{Crew Scheduling Problem} % (fold)

The Crew Scheduling Problem (CSP), as discussed in \cite{crew_scheduling_problem}, involves assigning crews to a sequence of tasks, each with defined start and end times, with the primary objective of ensuring that all tasks are covered while adhering to regulations on maximum working hours for crew members.

This problem is particularly critical for low-cost carriers, for instance in the United Kingdom in 2023, the low-cost carriers comprise 48\% of the scheduled capacity (total number of seats offered) \cite{lcc_new_norm}, which rely heavily on optimised crew schedules to maintain competitiveness. Efficient crew scheduling is essential not only for low cost carriers and for cost minimisation but also for ensuring operational reliability and flexibility in response to unexpected disruptions.  \cite{ryanair_youtube_report}


\subsection{Disruption Management} % (fold)
\label{sub:disruption management}

Disruptions in airline operations, as noted in %\cite{disruption_management}, 
can occur due to various factors, including crew unavailability, delays from air traffic control, adverse weather conditions, or mechanical failures. Given that flight schedules are typically planned months in advance \cite{flight_scheduling}, effective disruption management is crucial to minimise the impact on passengers and overall airline operations.

The two mains drivers of disruption management are aircraft recovery and crew recovery.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aircraft recovery: Reassigning aircraft to flights after disruption by taking care of schedules, airports availibility and maintenance. Optimisation tools help manage the complex logistics of matching available aircraft with rescheduled flights, considering factors like airport availability and maintenance requirements. This ensures that the revised schedules are as efficient and practical as possible. %\cite{inform_software}
    \item Crew recovery: reassigning crew members to flights by respecting all flights are staffed appropriattely. Optimisation tools are used to adjust crew schedules, taking into account factors such as legal working hours, crew availability, and the need to cover all flights efficiently. These tools help in developing feasible and compliant crew rosters that adapt to the new flight schedules. %\cite{ibs_software}
\end{itemize}

These optimization strategies, supported by advanced software from INFORM and IBS Software, are crucial for reducing the impact of disruptions and boosting operational resilience in the airline industry.

\subsection{Airline adaptation to new demand} % (fold)
\label{sub:Airline adaptation to new demand}
%\cite{flight_seasonnality_challenges}

Airlines must continuously adapt their schedules to meet evolving market demands, particularly with the growing dominance of leisure travel over business travel, which has introduced new patterns of demand seasonality, especially in Europe. This seasonality poses a challenge for airlines as they balance high demand during peak seasons with the risk of underutilisation during off-peak times.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{Figures/European Demand.png}
\end{figure}

The following are key strategies used by airlines to adapt to seasonal demand:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summer Peak}: Airlines schedule 65\% more seats in August than in February, deploying additional aircraft and crew to meet the heightened demand. Optimisation models help determine which routes to prioritise, the number of additional flights to add, and how to manage crew rotations to ensure smooth operations under high resource pressure.
    \item \textbf{Winter Through}: During winter, airlines face low demand, with many aircraft potentially sitting idle. To optimise operations, airlines may engage in ACMI leasing, temporarily reducing their owned fleet, and outsourcing capacity to adjust dynamically to lower demand. Maintenance activities are ramped up, and crew members are encouraged to take vacations or attend training, thereby optimising overall productivity.
    \item \textbf{Revenue Management}: Dynamic pricing algorithms adjust fares in real-time based on demand patterns. In summer, prices are optimised to capture the maximum willingness to pay from tourists, while in winter, prices might be adjusted to stimulate demand, filling otherwise empty seats and ensuring higher aircraft utilisation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Seasonal margin analysis.png}
    \caption{Compared with other sectors, airlines exhibit a significant and growing link between margins and seasons.}
    \label{fig:airline_seasonnality_margin}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Flight connection challenges} % (fold)
\label{sub:Flight connection challenges}

The problems of flight connections have been in the limelight for the past two years owing to the apparent difficulties of coming up with fast, inexpensive multi-city itinerary solutions. Air travel being a significant mode of locomotion for most of the world's population, travelers are using online avenues to find the best options in flights.

One of the well-known challenges in this respect is the Flying Tourist Problem, which aims at constructing the best multicity journey, given user-defined criteria such as minimal cost and travel time and maximal convenience. It is not just a matter of finding the cheapest flights, but working out an itinerary that efficiently joins a number of destinations, considering a variety of travel constraints.

The other major problem when dealing with the constraint of time-bound travel concerns travelers who need to adhere to certain schedules, such as spending some stipulated time at each or following the order of visits in some particular sequence. This adds a little complexity into planning, as it involves making sure that proper flight connections and timing are in place.

The more elaborate complications in the case of planning optimal flight routes have to do with the Air-Travelling Salesman Project. Here, it is required to find out the best possible sequence of flights between a set of airports with the constraint that most cases are there where there are no direct links from one arbitrary airport to another. That makes the problem hard to solve due to the requirement of intermediate stops, while the total traveling distance is at the same time desirable to be as small as possible.

These challenges underline the growing need for sophisticated methods of optimization to cope with the growing complexity of flight connections. With an increased number of airlines, destinations, and flights, efficient and user-friendly solutions for multi-city travel will certainly remain some of the most focused areas by researchers and the travel industry.

\section{Traveling Salesman problem and its adapation}


The Traveling Salesman Problem is a well known problem in the Operational Research and Computer Science area. The basic version of the TSP is to find the best roundtrip for a saleman that has to travel around a given number of cities while minimising the overall journey's distance.
This problem is characterised as $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard \cite{np_hardness}. This means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can solve all instances of the problem efficiently . In terms of time complexity, if we were to solve it explorating all the possible solutions the time complexity would have been $\mathcal{O}(\frac{(n-1)!}{2})$ where $n$ represents the number of cities.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/NP-hardness - time complexity.png}
    \caption{Time complexity of different functions \cite{time_complexity}}
    \label{fig:time_complexity_comparisons}
\end{figure}

On Figure \ref{fig:time_complexity_comparisons}, different time complexity are compared and the factorial time complexity is the worst. That means that these kinds of $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard problem are typically not solved exploiting all the search area but using heuristics algorithms. Heuristics solutions do not guarantee to find the absolute optimal solution but can find near-optimal solutions in a much more reasonnable times.

The TSP has been studied a lot, especially because from the TSP il d√©coule de nombreux variantes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric TSP (STSP): The distance between cities are symmetric, meaning that the distance to travel from city A to city B is the same as from city B to city A. %\cite{STSP}
    \item Assymetric TSP (ATSP): The distance between cities are assymetric, meaning that the distance to travel from city A to city B is different than the distance to travel from city B to city A.\cite{ASTP}
    \item Multiple TSP (mTSP): Instead of one salesman, multiple salesman are starting from one city visit all the cities such that each city is visited exactly once. \cite{mTSP}
    \item Time Window TSP (TWTSP): Each city has to be visited in a defined time slot. \cite{TWTSP}
    \item Price-collection TSP (PCTSP): Not all the cities have to be visited, the goal is to to minimise the overall traveler's distance while maximising the price collected earned when visiting a city. \cite{PCTSP}
    \item Stochastic TSP (STSP): The distances between the cities or the cost of travels are stochastic (\i.e random variables) rather than deterministic. \cite{Stochastic_TSP}
    \item Dynamic TSP (DTSP): The problem can change over the times, that means that new cities can be added or distances between cities can change while the salesman has already started his journey. \cite{DTSP}
    \item Generalised TSP (GTSP): The cities are grouped into clusters, the goal is to visit exactly one city from each cluster. \cite{GTSP}
    \item Open TSP (OTSP): The traveler does not have to end his journey at the starting city. \cite{OTSP}
\end{itemize}

Multiple algorithms have been developed to address these TSP variants, we can classify them into two major categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exact Algorithms}: These algorithms aim to find the optimal solution to the TSP by exploring all possible routes or by using mathematical techniques to prune the search space efficiently. Examples include:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Branch and Bound}: This method systematically explores the set of all possible solutions, using bounds to eliminate parts of the search space that cannot contain the optimal solution. It is often used for smaller instances of TSP due to its computational intensity. \cite{branch_and_bound}
              \item \textbf{Cutting Planes}: This technique adds constraints (or cuts) to the TSP formulation iteratively to remove infeasible solutions and converge to the optimal solution. This approach is particularly effective for symmetric TSPs. \cite{cutting_planes}
              \item \textbf{Dynamic Programming}: Introduced by Bellman, this approach breaks down the TSP into subproblems and solves them recursively, which is highly effective for specific TSP variants, though its complexity grows exponentially. \cite{dynamic_programming_tsp}
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Approximation and Heuristic Algorithms}: These algorithms are designed to find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame, especially for large-scale problems where exact methods are computationally infeasible. Examples include:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Greedy Algorithms}: These algorithms make a series of locally optimal choices in the hope of finding a global optimum. An example is the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, which selects the nearest unvisited city at each step. \cite{greedy}
              \item \textbf{Genetic Algorithms}: Inspired by the process of natural selection, these algorithms evolve a population of solutions over time, using operations such as mutation and crossover to explore the solution space. \cite{genetic_algorithm}
              \item \textbf{Simulated Annealing}: This probabilistic technique searches for a global optimum by allowing moves to worse solutions based on a temperature parameter that gradually decreases. It is particularly useful for escaping local optima. \cite{simulated_annealing}
              \item \textbf{Ant Colony Optimization}: This metaheuristic is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants and uses a combination of deterministic and probabilistic rules to construct solutions, gradually improving them through pheromone updates. \cite{ant_colony}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Some TSP problems (or its variants) have been solved using other algorithms, hence they are less traditionnal than those mentionned.

\newpage
\section{The Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm}

The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm can be characterised less traditionnal than the previously enounced method in the previous subsection to solve TSP because MCTS is typically used in games. MCTS' (and its variants)
have been successfully implemented across a range of games, such as Havannah \cite{wiki:board_game},  Amazons \cite{wiki:Game_of_the_Amazons}, Lines of Actions \cite{wiki:Lines_of_Action}, Go, chess, and Shogi \cite{wiki:Shogi}, establishing it as the state-of-the-art method for many of these games \cite{havannah}, \cite{amazons}, \cite{lines_of_actions}. It is widely use in board games and has been really popular when Google DeepMind developed AlphaGo. AlphaGo is a software that was created to beat the best Go's player in the world.

Go is an ancient board game from China where two players take turns placing black or white stones on a grid. The goal is to capture territory by surrounding empty spaces or the opponent‚Äôs stones. Despite its simple rules, Go is incredibly deep and complex, with countless possible moves and strategies. It is known for its balance between intuition and logic, hence it has been a significant focus of artificial intelligence research. \cite{wiki:Go}

In 2016, Lee Sedol \cite{wiki:Lee_Sedol} - the best Go's player in the world has been beaten by AlphaGo 4-1 \cite{alpha_go_documentary}.

MCTS with policy and value networks are at the heart of AlphaGo's decision-making process, enabling AlphaGo's to pick the optimal moves in the complex search of Go. \cite{mcts_alpha_go_algorithm}



\subsection{Overview}
The MCTS' process is conceptually straightforward. A tree is built in an incremental and assymatric manner (Figure \ref{fig:Assymetrical_growth_MCTS}).
For every iteration, a selection policy is used to determine which node we have to select in the tree to perform simulations.
The selection policy balances the exploration  i.e.\ look into part of the tree that have not been visited yet and the exploitation i.e.\ look into part of the trees that appear to be promising.
Once the node is selected, a simulation i.e.\ a sequence of available actions, based on a simulation policy, are applied from this node until a terminal condition is reached e.g\ no further actions are possible. \cite{mcts_various_policies}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/assymetric_growth_mcts_tree.png}
    \caption{Assymetrical growth of MCTS - Simulation and Expansion - \cite{mcts_assymetrical_growth}}
    \label{fig:Assymetrical_growth_MCTS}
\end{figure}
To ensure that the reader understands the various stages of the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm, we will begin by looking at a detailed example. This example will illustrate each component of the algorithm in action. We will then generalise the principles discussed, as the basic methodology of this paper is based on the application of the MCTS algorithm.
\newpage


\subsection{Example }
\label{Example}
Let's say we are given a maximisation problem. When starting the game, you have two possible actions $a_1$ and $a_2$ from $S^{0,0}_0$ in the tree $\mathcal{T}$.
Every node is defined like so: $S^{n_i,t_i}_i$ where $n_i$ represents the number of times node $i$ has been visited, $t_i$ the total score of this node.
Furthermore, for every node - we can compute a selection metric, here the $UCB1$ value: $UCB1(S^{n_i,t_i}_i)=\bar{V_i} + 2 \sqrt{\frac{\ln N}{n_i}}$ where $\bar{V_i}=\frac{n_i}{t_i}$ represents the average value of the node, $n_i$ the number of times node $i$ has been visited, $N=n_0$ the number of times the root node has been visited/the number of iterations.

Before the first iteration, none node have been visited - $\forall i \in \mathcal{T}, S^{0,0}_{i}$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
            root_node/.style={circle, draw=orange!60, fill=orange!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
            visited_node/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
            unvisited_node/.style={circle, draw=gray!60, fill=gray!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
            target_node/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
        ]

        \node[root_node](Root){$S^{0,0}_0$};
        \node[unvisited_node, below left=of Root](S1){$S^{0,0}_1$};
        %\node[target_node, below=of S1, yshift=-1.7cm](Target){};
        \node[unvisited_node, below right=of Root](S2){$S^{0,0}_2$};

        \draw[->] (Root) -- (S1) node[midway, above, xshift=-2mm] {$a_1$};
        \draw[->] (Root) -- (S2) node[midway, above, xshift=2mm] {$a_2$};

        %\draw[->, very thick, decorate, decoration={snake, amplitude=.7mm, segment length=3mm}] (S1) -- (Target);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Selection - $I1$}
    \label{fig:Expansion of the tree from the root node}
\end{figure}
At the beginning of $I1$, we then have to choose between these two child nodes (or choose between taking $a_1$ or $a_2$). We then have to calculate the $UCB1$ value for these two nodes and pick the node that maximises the $UCB1$ value (as we are dealing with a maximisation problem).
In Figure \ref{fig:Expansion of the tree from the root node}, neither of these have been visited yet so $USB(S^{0,0}_1)=UCB1(S^{0,0}_2)=\infty$. Hence we decide to choose randomly $S^{0,0}_1$.

$S^{0,0}_1$ is a leaf node that has not been visited - then we can simulate from this node i.e.\ selecting actions from this node based on the simulation policy to a terminal state as shown on Figure \ref{fig:Simulation - $I1$}:

\begin{figure}[!ht]

            unvisited_node/.style={circle, draw=gray!60, fill=gray!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
            target_node/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=40},
        ]

        \node[root_node](Root){$S^{0,0}_0$};
        \node[unvisited_node, below left=of Root](S1){$S^{0,0}_1$};
        \node[target_node, below=of S1, yshift=-1.7cm](Target){20};
        \node[unvisited_node, below right=of Root](S2){$S^{0,0}_2$};

        \draw[->] (Root) -- (S1) node[midway, above, xshift=-2mm] {$a_1$};
        \draw[->] (Root) -- (S2) node[midway, above, xshift=2mm] {$a_2$};

        \draw[->, very thick, decorate, decoration={snake, amplitude=.7mm, segment length=3mm}] (S1) -- (Target);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Simulation - $I1$}
    \label{fig:Simulation - $I1$}
\end{figure}

\newpage
The terminal state has a value of 20, we can write that the rollout/simulation from node $S^{0,0}_1$ node is $\mathcal{R}(S^{0,0}_1)=20$ . The final step of $I1$ is backpropagation. Every node that has been visited in the iteration is updated.
Let $\mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{R},j}$ be the indexes of the nodes visited during the $j-th$ iteration of the MCTS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before backpropagation:
          \begin{equation}
              \forall i \in \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{R},j}, S^{n_i,t_i}_{i,old}
          \end{equation}

    \item After backpropagation:
          \begin{equation}
              \forall i \in \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{R},j}, S^{n_i+1,t_i+\mathcal{R}(S^{n_i,t_i}_{i,old})}_{i,new}
          \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

We can then define a backpropagation function:
\begin{center}
    \centering
    $\begin{array}{ccccc}
            \mathcal{B} & : & \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{R},j} & \to     & \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{R},j}                    \\
                        &   & S^{n_i,t_i}_{i}             & \mapsto & S^{n_i+1,t_i+\mathcal{R}(S^{n_i,t_i}_{i})}_{i} \\
        \end{array}$
\end{center}



\newpage
Then, back to our example on Figure \ref{fig:Backpropagation_I1} we update the nodes $\mathcal{B}(S^{0,0}_1)=S^{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{20}}_1$ and $\mathcal{B}(S^{0,0}_0)=S^{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{20}}_0$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

        ]

        \node[root_node](Root){$S^{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{20}}_0$};
        \node[unvisited_node, below left=of Root](S1){$S^{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{20}}_1$};
        \node[target_node, below=of S1, yshift=-1.7cm](Target){20};
        \node[unvisited_node, below right=of Root](S2){$S^{0,0}_2$};

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Backpropagation - I1}

The fourth phase of the algorithm have been done for $I1$. We can then start the $2^{nd}$ iteration $I2$.

        \node[right=2cm of S2, anchor=west] (UCB1) {$UCB(S^{1,20}_1)=20+2 \sqrt{\frac{\ln1}{1}} = 20$};

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Selection - I2}
    \label{fig:Selection - I2}
\end{figure}
On Figure \ref{fig:Selection - I2}, we can either choose $a_1$ or $a_2$. When a child node has not been visited yet, you pick this node for the Selection or you can compute the $UCB1$ value, it leads to the same conclusion.

\newpage
We can then simulate (Figure \ref{fig:Simulation and Backpropagation - I2}) from the chosen node $S^{0,0}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{R}(S^{0,0}_{2})=10$ and backpropagate all the visited nodes: $\mathcal{B}(S^{0,0}_{2})=S^{1,10}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(S^{1,20}_{0})=S^{2,30}_{0}$.
We now start the $3^{rd}$ iteration, based on the $UCB1$ score we decide to choose $a_1$.

If we were to stop at this stage of the algortihm, the best action to undertake is $a_2$ because it has the higher average value: $\bar{V_1}=\frac{20}{2} \le \bar{V_2}=\frac{24}{2}$.

\subsection{The different parameters in the MCTS}


\subsection{Selection policy}
\cite{different_selection_policies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{Description}: UCB is a popular selection policy in MCTS that balances exploration and exploitation using a mathematical formulation that considers both the average reward of a node and the uncertainty of that reward.
              \item \textit{Trade-offs}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}: UCB adjusts the balance between exploring less-visited nodes and exploiting nodes with high rewards.
                        \item \textbf{Parameter Sensitivity}: The performance of UCB depends on the constant \(C_p\) in its formula, which controls the level of exploration.
                        \item \textbf{Children's Count}: UCB can lead to varying numbers of children being explored, depending on the setting of \(C_p\).
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{UCB1-Tuned:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{Description}: A variation of UCB that dynamically adjusts the exploration term based on the variance of rewards, making it more adaptive to different scenarios.
              \item \textit{Trade-offs}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Adaptivity}: UCB1-Tuned can adapt to the variance in the rewards, potentially leading to better performance in complex environments.
                        \item \textbf{Computational Cost}: The added complexity in adjusting the exploration term may lead to higher computational costs.
                        \item \textbf{Children's Count}: This policy may result in fewer nodes being selected for expansion when the variance is low, focusing more on exploitation.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Single-Player (SP-MCTS):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{Description}: A variant of MCTS specifically designed for single-player scenarios, incorporating a third term in the UCB formula to account for the uncertainty in node values.
              \item \textit{Trade-offs}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Exploration of Uncertainty}: SP-MCTS inflates the uncertainty term for less-visited nodes, which can lead to more thorough exploration in single-player settings.
                        \item \textbf{Focus on Strong Lines}: This policy tends to favor strong lines of play, potentially neglecting less promising but necessary exploratory paths.
                        \item \textbf{Children's Count}: Tends to explore a wider range of children nodes, balancing between known strong strategies and potential new solutions.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bayesian UCT:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{Description}: Bayesian UCT integrates Bayesian statistics into the selection policy, allowing for a probabilistic approach to balancing exploration and exploitation.
              \item \textit{Trade-offs}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Probabilistic Exploration}: Bayesian UCT provides a more nuanced exploration strategy by considering prior knowledge and updating beliefs as more information is gathered.
                        \item \textbf{Complexity}: The Bayesian approach can be computationally expensive, especially in large search spaces.
                        \item \textbf{Children's Count}: The number of children explored under Bayesian UCT can be influenced by the prior distributions used, potentially leading to more focused exploration in areas of high uncertainty.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
