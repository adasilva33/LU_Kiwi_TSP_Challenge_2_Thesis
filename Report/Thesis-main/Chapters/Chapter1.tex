\section{Background}

\section{Research objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Goal of this dissertation is to solve Kiwi's challenge with a method that has not been utilised yet
    \item No focus on the time limit - use Python and we then cannot compete against other participants - will be for later
    \item Try to find better solutions than the state of the art for some instances
    \item Big instances (instances I9,I10 etc) - not a major focus because they do not represent potential use case, but to study
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic publication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss with Ahmed - implentation in C to speed up the code
    \item + think of new smart policies to solve the instances in more reasonnable time
\end{itemize}
