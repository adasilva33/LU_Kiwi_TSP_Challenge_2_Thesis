\section{Background}

The number of flights connection keep increasing every year \cite{statista_flights_year}, more than have 38 millions flights have been scheduled in 2023 - hence it is a challenge for traveler's to find the best and cheapest flight connections for their specific journey, especially when one has to visit a big number of cities/areas.
Consequently, traveler agencies have deployed online trip planner algorithm in order to find flights connection that match traveler's requirement. For example, Google Flights, skyscanner, Kayak and Kiwi.com.

These agencies have launched different challenges in order to create and build powerful trip planner algorithm. For instance, as mentionned in \cite{reinforcement_learning_yaro}, OpenFlights.org launched the Air Travelling Salesman project and Kiwi.com has launched a project in 2017 called Traveling Salesman Challenge where the current algorithm used by Kiwi.com was developed and proposed a new challenge in 2018, the Traveling Salesman Problem 2.0 which is the focus of this study.



\section{Research objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Goal of this dissertation is to solve Kiwi's challenge with a method that has not been used yet
    \item No focus on the time limit - use Python and we then cannot compete against other participants - will be for later
    \item Try to find better solutions than the state of the art for some instances
    \item Big instances (instances I9,I10 etc) - not a major focus because they do not represent potential use case, but to study
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic publication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss with Ahmed - implentation in C to speed up the code
    \item + think of new smart policies to solve the instances in more reasonnable time
\end{itemize}
