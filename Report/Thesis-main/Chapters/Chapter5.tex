\lhead{Chapter 5. \emph{Results and performance}}

\todo{Present the results and discuss any differences between the findings and your initial predictions/hypothesis}

\todo{Interpret your experimental results - do not just present lots of data and expect the reader to understand it.
Evaluate what you have achieved against the aims and objectives you outlined in the introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on the different rollout policy, analyse the output -> the greey is deterministic whereqs the 2 others are stochastic
    \item Maybe try to fine tune the selection policy -> one idea could be instead of returning the average score is to return the min score 
    \item Compare outputs with known solutions - Yaro + litterature -> efficiency in terms of time
    \item Ahmed - litterature : https://code.kiwi.com/articles/travelling-salesman-challenge-2-0-wrap-up/
