I would like to particularly thanks Ahmed Kheiri, my tutor, who guided me throughout
this work. I would also like to express my gratitude to Yaroslav Pylyavskyy for his
valuable insights and feedbacks on this project. Finally, I would like to thank the
Management Science Department at Lancaster University who have taught me a lot
during this final year of my studies.
